# OncoLink - Comprehensive Oncology Support Platform

## Overview
OncoLink is a comprehensive platform designed to support cancer patients and healthcare providers with tools for meal planning, AI-powered diagnostics, and secure communication. The communications module is available as a separate component: [OncoLink Communications](https://github.com/your-username/oncolink-communications).

## Features

### 1. AI-Powered Chemotherapy Efficacy Predictor
Our advanced machine learning model predicts the efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapy drugs, helping oncologists make more informed treatment decisions.

### 2. Intelligent 7-Day Meal Planner
Our advanced meal planning system generates a complete 7-day meal plan with breakfast, lunch, and dinner options, specifically designed for cancer patients' nutritional needs.

Key Features:
- Utilizes the **Knapsack Algorithm** to optimize meal nutrition within dietary constraints
- Implements **N-Queens Algorithm** to ensure meal variety and prevent repetition
- Includes **Extra Meals** section with alternative options for easy substitutions
- Customized based on treatment stage and dietary restrictions
