The Oncolink web application utilizes a modern, full-stack technology stack designed for scalability, maintainability, and user experience. The frontend is built with React, leveraging Create React App for rapid development and React Router for seamless navigation between views. Styling is accomplished through a combination of CSS modules and custom stylesheets, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing interface. The backend is powered by Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, which exposes RESTful APIs for user authentication, AI-driven diagnostics, and meal planning. Machine learning integration is achieved using PyTorch and scikit-learn, with pre-trained models loaded for real-time inference. Data persistence is handled via SQLite databases, providing a simple yet effective solution for managing user and application data. Static assets, including the meal planner, are served as standalone HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, enabling direct interaction with backend services. This cohesive stack enables Oncolink to deliver advanced features, robust security, and a user-friendly experience for both patients and clinicians.
